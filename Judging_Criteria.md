Sui Warszaw x Wroclaw Hackathon

Judging Criteria

Submissions will be evaluated based on four primary pillars, ordered by importance:
Implementation, Design, Idea, and Outcome (UX). These are aligned with the core goals of
building robust, scalable, and meaningful applications on the Sui Blockchain.

1️⃣ Implementation – Code Quality, Functionality, and Testing - 40%
● Code Quality: Is the code clean, modular, maintainable, and well-documented?
● Functionality: Does it behave as expected? Are there critical bugs?
● Testing & Reliability: Are tests implemented? Do they cover key logic paths? (Note:
Testing is used mainly as a tie-breaker.)
● GitHub Standards: Is the repository public, structured, and organized for review?

2️⃣ Design – Architectural Fit with Sui's Model -30%
● System Architecture: How well was the design planned around Sui’s object-centric
architecture, native parallelism, and scalability?
● Access Control & Logic Design: Does the design appropriately restrict or delegate
access using Sui’s paradigms?
● Integration with Ecosystem: Are Sui-native tools (e.g., wallets, APIs, oracles) utilized
effectively?
● Code Organization: Is the logical structure clear and scalable

3️⃣ Idea – Problem Fit, Feasibility, and Blockchain Relevance - 20%
● Problem-Solution Fit: Does the idea address a real-world or significant issue?
● Blockchain Relevance: Is the idea meaningfully improved by decentralization or
immutability?

● Originality & Vision: Does it demonstrate a fresh, inventive approach that could evolve
into a viable blockchain-native project?

4️⃣ Outcome (UX) – Integration & End-User Experience – 10%
● Working Product: Is the backend, smart contracts, and frontend connected and
functioning?
● User Interface: Is it intuitive and accessible? Does it make complex blockchain
interactions easy to use?
● Presentation: Is there a clear demo or walkthrough of the product?

Challenges
✨ More working projects done (tests are passed, contact deployed, UI functioning)
✨ Quality improvements introduced.
✨ Extra features implemented

🔹 Bonus Points: Innovation & Creativity
For close submissions, bonus credit may be given to projects that push the boundaries of what’s
possible with Sui and Move.
